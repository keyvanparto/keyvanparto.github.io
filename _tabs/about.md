Hello!

My name is Keyvan and I am deeply passionate about Machine Learning, LLMs, and everything related to artificial intelligence. I consider myself an avid consumer of knowledge, and it is precisely to embrace this inclination that, after earning a degree in Computer Engineering, I decided to enroll in a Master's program in Artificial Intelligence and Human-Centered Computing, which I am currently pursuing.

Before diving into computer science, I nurtured my love for writing, literature, and non-fiction. How? By reading and writing extensively, of course, and by earning a degree in Modern Literature.

I created this website because I believe it’s the best way to give voice to these two worlds that coexist within me.

Here, I will share my journey, my projects, and the challenges I face in the vast world of artificial intelligence, to solidify what I learn and, at the same time, hopefully inspire or help those who are on a similar path.

For me, learning is not just a personal experience; it’s an opportunity to create connections and share experiences.

So, if you’re looking for me, you know where to find me.

Happy reading!
